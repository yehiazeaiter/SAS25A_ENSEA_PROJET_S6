# SAS25A_ENSEA_PROJET_S6

This repository contains the code and documentation for our first year school project. An embedded systems project using STM32CubeIDE to build a robot that plays hide and seek in a labyrinth using motors for moving, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and an infrared sensor for detecting the other playing robot.

## Project Overview

This embedded systems project aimed to build a robot capable of playing a game of hide-and-seek using sensors and motor control, based on the STM32L476RG microcontroller, in a compact design with an integrated PCB.

### What We Achieved
- The robot can **move forward** using DC motors
- It **stops automatically** when an obstacle is detected via the ultrasonic sensor
- It **blinks an LED** when receiving a signal from the infrared receiver
- A PCB design ready to print

### What Was Not Fully Implemented
- Autonomous hide-and-seek behavior
- Navigation or decision-making logic
- Compact design with an integrated PCB

Despite not reaching the original goal, the project successfully integrates core embedded system concepts such as motor control, sensor interfacing, and interrupt-based signaling.
