## What it is for
This module is used to measure distances between 3 cm and 2 meters (otherwise it loses accuracy)

## Constitution
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic module is equiped with two main parts, an ultrasonic transmitter, and an ultrasonic receiver. It contains 4 pins : 
- 5V pin to power the module
- Trigger pin to control the transmitter
- Echo pin to read the receiver
- GND pin

## How it works
The ultrasonic transmitter sends periodic ultrasonic pulses of 10 Î¼s period. Upon detecting an object, these waves are reflected towards the receiver. Therefore, the time it takes for these waves to travel to the object forth and back is used to calculate the distance.
